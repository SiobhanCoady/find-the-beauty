Hi! I'm Siobhan. I've created this site for myself as a reminder to seek out the beautiful things in life and keep a record of them. The Find the Beauty Project is all about noticing what's already right in front of me, even when things seem hard. Especially when things seem hard. I hope you'll find a reminder of the many delights that exist in the world while you're here.
